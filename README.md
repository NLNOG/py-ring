py-ring
=======
py-ring - a python module for interacting with the NLNOG ring (being) 
written by Teun Vink.

Information on the NLNOG ring can be found at https://ring.nlnog.net. 
This module is designed to operate specifically on the NLNOG ring. 
Without access to it, this code isn't that useful.


For now, this is just a place to store stuff until we have something 
decent.
